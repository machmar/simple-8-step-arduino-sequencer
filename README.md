# simple-8-step-arduino-sequencer
A simple eurorack 8step sequencer with a variable lenght and two CV outputs(one of them is reversed). All can be controlled by CV. Also use the code without the OLED.

Animations:
          Unplug the clock pin.  
          Select the animations speed with the steplenght knob(Note, you cant use cv to controll the speed but I might add it).
          Select the animation with the hold button(slower the clock-slower the response, so you have to olh it to change the animation, and you can controll this with the hold input)
          You can still use the sequencer - the leds are hard-wired-that means, that ifd led 1 is on than the poteciometer one is being used, and the same goes for the other steps as well. This is true all the time.
          To get back to normal sequencer, just plug the clock back in.
